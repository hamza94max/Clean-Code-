<summary> MeaningFul Names </summary>
  <br>
   Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes.
So take care with your names and change them when you find better ones. Everyone who
reads your code (including you) will be happier if you do.
<br><br>
  • The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It
should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent. <br>
 <br><br>
• Avoid Disinformation ( Information that will mislead you ) : a truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case @L or
uppercase O as variable names 
   <br><br>
- Avoid noise Words : Noise words are redundant. The word **variable** should never appear in a variable
name. The word **table** should never appear in a table name.
 <br><br>
• Use **Searchable Names**
